### Overview
This is a Open API Project based on Swapi.Tech - an API about Star Wars films that you can download and run locally on your machine.
It includes simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Instructions:

1. Fork this GitHub repository to make a copy of it to your GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right.
    - This opens a new page where you can retitle your copy of this repository.
    - Once you've completed forking the repository, be sure you're looking at your copy.
2. Click the green "Code" button, select HTTPS, and copy the URL for your repository by clicking the clipboard icon.
3. Clone this repository so that the code is available on your local machine. 
4. Open the inde .html file in your preferred web browser.


### Requirements

## STRUCTURE:
- [ ] A public GitHub repository containing your project
- [ ] An HTML document for the page
- [ ] A CSS document to style the HTML page
- [ ] A JavaScript file that retrieves data from one of several public API sources to display the data on your HTML page
- [ ] A README file that includes the instructions for running the webpage (This does not need to be a live site; you can instruct the user to download and run locally)

## CONTENT:
- [ ] Display the data for at least 2 of the models/data points in the API
- [ ] Include navigation from each modelâ€™s page to the other models that are displayed. This means your site should have at least two clickable navigation links. When the user clicks each link you can either route them to a different HTML file that displays the data you get from your API call, or you can re-render your single HTML page to update with the new data.
- [ ] Issue new GET requests for the linked data to display in the linked pages. You should be using two separate GET requests for each of the two data points so when the user clicks a navigation button it triggers the GET request for that data.

## FUNCTIONALITY:
- [ ] Code runs without issues by following the instructions in the README file
- [ ] Navigation between the different models behaves properly and is not slowed down by requesting more data than needs to be displayed
- [ ] Code is readable and well structured
- [ ] If applicable, error cases are appropriately handled
- [ ] Styling is effective (example: font-sizes are not too small or large, colors are not too dark/light to be easily seen, etc.)
